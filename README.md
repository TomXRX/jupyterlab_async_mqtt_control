# jupyterlab_async_mqtt_control
bad naming I know. I'm just trying to learn how to use git.

it is using Docker Compose to deploy.

And the goal is to integrate with Micropython.

now is trying to establish easy connection using mqtt, between clients. ( Even with-in the jupyter notebook. I really do not have a good way to share variables between two running kernels. ( I mean, not intuitive enough for me to understand.)

jupyter and asyncio works well together. Which is really fun. Not very intuitive though, at least better than using Threads.
